# Mathematical Conjectures AI Engine

This module implements an AI engine that leverages advanced mathematical conjectures for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.

## Overview

The module provides implementations of several advanced mathematical conjectures, including:

- Schanuel's Conjecture
- Rota's Basis Conjecture
- Hadamard Conjecture
- Brouwer Fixed-Point Conjecture for Infinite-Dimensional Spaces
- Density of Rational Points on K3 Surfaces
- Satoâ€“Tate Conjecture
- Existence of Odd Perfect Numbers
- Seymour's Second Neighborhood Conjecture
- Jacobian Conjecture
- Lonely Runner Conjecture
- Riemann Hypothesis
- P vs NP Problem
- Collatz Conjecture

Each conjecture is implemented as a Python class that can evaluate numerical data and determine how well it aligns with the conjecture's mathematical properties.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The mathematical conjectures engine can be run from the command line:

```bash
# Analyze data with all conjectures
python run.py --mode conjectures --input-data path/to/data.csv --output-file results.json

# Analyze with specific conjectures
python run.py --mode conjectures --input-data path/to/data.csv --specific-conjectures "Riemann Hypothesis,Collatz Conjecture"
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from algorithms.conjecture_ai_engine import conjecture_ai_engine
import numpy as np

# Create some test data
data = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 8.0, 13.0, 21.0])

# Analyze with all conjectures
results = conjecture_ai_engine.analyze(data)
print(f"Overall score: {results['weighted_score']:.3f}")

# Get top conjectures
for name, score in results['top_conjectures']:
    print(f"{name}: {score:.3f}")

# See insights
for insight in results['insights']:
    print(f"- {insight}")

# Analyze with specific conjectures
specific_results = conjecture_ai_engine.analyze_specific(
    data,
    ["Riemann Hypothesis", "P vs NP Problem"]
)
```

### Adding Custom Conjectures

You can create your own conjecture implementations by extending the `MathematicalConjecture` base class:

```python
from algorithms.mathematical_conjectures import MathematicalConjecture

class MyCustomConjecture(MathematicalConjecture):
    def __init__(self, confidence=0.6):
        super().__init__(name="My Custom Conjecture", confidence=confidence)

    def evaluate(self, input_data):
        # Your evaluation logic here
        # Return a score between 0 and 1
        return score

# Add to the engine
from algorithms.conjecture_ai_engine import conjecture_ai_engine
conjecture_ai_engine.add_custom_conjecture(MyCustomConjecture())
```

## Input Data Format

The engine accepts:

- Numerical arrays (numpy arrays or python lists)
- CSV files (automatically flattened to a 1D array)
- Text files with space-separated numbers

## Architecture

- `mathematical_conjectures.py`: Core framework and base classes
- `conjecture_implementations.py`: Implementations of specific conjectures
- `conjecture_ai_engine.py`: High-level engine that orchestrates conjectures

## Performance Considerations

- The conjecture evaluations are approximations of complex mathematical principles
- Higher-dimensional data may require more computational resources
- Some conjectures are more computationally intensive than others
