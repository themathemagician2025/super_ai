    Update the 'Upcoming' and 'Bets' tables in the database with match predictions for upcoming games.

    This function identifies matches scheduled for the next five days and updates their corresponding records 
    in the 'Upcoming' and 'Bets' tables. If a match is already listed in the 'Upcoming' table, the function 
    checks if there are existing bet predictions for it. If there are, it updates these predictions; if not, 
    it creates new ones. If a match is not yet listed in the 'Upcoming' table, the function adds it, along 
    with the corresponding bet predictions.

    Once all updates and additions have been made, the function calls `remove_played_matches` to clean up 
    the 'Upcoming' table by removing matches that have already been played and migrating them to the 
    'Performance' table.

    Args:
        session (sqlalchemy.orm.Session): The SQLAlchemy Session object for database interaction.
        model (tf.keras.Model): The TensorFlow Keras model to be used for match predictions.
