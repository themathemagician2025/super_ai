I want to make it absolutely clear that:
- I am not looking for a job.
- I'm doing this purely as a hobby. I have no intention of working in software, data science, or AI professionally.
- I do not aim to compete with elite companies or other developers.

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Background
I am a Petroleum Engineer by profession ‚Äî not a data scientist, not a software engineer. My work in AI and programming is strictly personal and driven by curiosity, not by career ambitions or business goals.

## üß™ Purpose
- Self-driven curiosity
- No commercial aspirations
- Not competing with companies or individuals

Please view this project in the spirit it was created: a personal hobby project by someone who loves building things for fun.
