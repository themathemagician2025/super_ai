    """Main function for processing raw match data and generating processed data for the model.

    Steps performed by the function:
    1. Retrieve the raw match IDs and processed match IDs from the database to determine which matches to process.
    2. Filter out the matches that have already been processed.
    3. Iterate over the remaining raw matches and generate processed data for each team involved in the match.
    4. Create Processed objects with the necessary data (match ID, league ID, inputs, labels) for each team.
    5. Add the Processed objects to the session and commit the changes to the database.

    Parameters:
    - session: SQLAlchemy session object for interacting with the database.

    Note: The function assumes that the necessary helper functions (features_for_model0, labels) are available.
